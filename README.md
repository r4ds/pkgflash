While modern IDEs make it easy to look up arguments to functions, if you
actually know function syntax, you can read and understand code more
quickly (see [*The Programmer’s Brain* by Felienne
Hermans](https://livebook.manning.com/book/the-programmers-brain/chapter-3/)
for more information). {pkgflash} generates flashcards to make it easier
to learn the syntax of a package’s exported functions.

## Installation

You can install the development version of pkgflash from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("r4ds/pkgflash")
```

## Example

There’s no actual code yet, but I will add something here very soon. If
you see this, and the package actually exports a function, please file
an issue!
