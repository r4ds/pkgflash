Description: While modern IDEs make it easy to look up arguments to functions, 
    if you actually know function syntax, you can read and understand code more
    quickly (see 
    https://livebook.manning.com/book/the-programmers-brain/chapter-3/). This 
    package generates flashcards to make it easier to learn the syntax of a 
    package's exported functions.
